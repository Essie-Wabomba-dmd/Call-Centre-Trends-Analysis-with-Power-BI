# Call-Centre-Trends-Analysis-with-Power-BI
Visualizing customer and agent behavior.

**Background**

The aim of this exercise is to look into transparency and insight into the data at the Call Centre. For example: total number of calls answered and abandoned, speed of answer, length of calls, overall customer satisfaction and any other relevant observations. I need to create a great visualization in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset, which will later be used by management for decision making.

**Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):**

- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- Average speed of answer
- Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

**Data Source**

This data was provided by PwC Switzerland as part of the project task, as a virtual intern through Forage.

**Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**

I had to export data in Power BI desktop and in transformation phase, I had a glance of it. The data consists of 10 columns and 500 rows. The columns are Call Id, Agent, Date, Time, Topic, Calls Answered, Resolved Calls, Speed of answer in seconds, Average Call Duration and Satisfaction Rating.

The data given comprises of seven days of the week, Monday to Friday for first three months of th year 2021, January, February and March.
